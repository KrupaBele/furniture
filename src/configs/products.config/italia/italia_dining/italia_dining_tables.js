As a child he already had a strong interest in creativity, through the work of his father Mario Bellini, a distinguished figure in Italian design. Claudio Bellini evolved as a famed designer, but he kept his curiosity that allows him to be enthusiastic about every phase of design process. He has an open-minded attitude, combined with a peculiar sensibility for different culture and historical heritage.`,
